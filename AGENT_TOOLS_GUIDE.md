## 🔢 Calculations

### Commission Formula
```
Total Commission = Monthly Rent × (Commission Rate / 100)
Brokerage Fee = Total Commission × (Brokerage Split / 100)
Your Commission = Total Commission - Brokerage Fee
Net Earnings = Your Commission
```

### Example
```
Monthly Rent: $2,500
Commission Rate: 15%
Brokerage Split: 50%

Total: $2,500 × 0.15 = $375
Brokerage: $375 × 0.50 = $187.50
Your Take: $375 - $187.50 = $187.50
```
