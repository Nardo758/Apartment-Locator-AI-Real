Overview
The Apartments.com Search Results and Details Scraper allows you to efficiently extract detailed rental listing information from Apartments.com, including apartments, houses for rent, condos, and individual property detail pages across the United States and Canada. Whether you're conducting market research, comparing rental rates, or analyzing property data for investment purposes, this scraper provides a streamlined way to gather structured information from a wide range of property types.

With Apartments.com hosting thousands of rental listings, this scraper is a useful tool for collecting and analyzing apartment, house, and condo data, including prices, amenities, and location details in both US and Canadian markets.

Scrape apartment, house, and condo search results directly from Apartments.com to collect data like titles, rent prices, unit availability, and location information
Extract comprehensive details from each property, including amenities, property features, and contact details
Scrape directly from individual property detail pages for apartments, houses, or condos
Flexible input to scrape from any category or search results page on Apartments.com, including apartments, houses, and condos
Configurable settings for maximum concurrency, request retries, and proxy setup for reliable scraping
Option to scrape each individual listing's detail page for even more detailed information, such as specific amenities, parking fees, pet policies, and walkability scores
How to Use

Provide Start URLs: Add the URLs you want to scrape. These URLs can be from Apartments.com's search results page for apartments, houses, condos, or directly from any property detail page.

Input Fields Explanation
Start URLs (startUrls): URLs to start scraping from. These can be search results pages for apartments, houses, condos, or direct detail pages on Apartments.com. The scraper supports both US and Canadian listings (e.g., https://www.apartments.com/toronto-on/ for Toronto, Canada).

Max Request Retries (maxRequestRetries): Number of times the scraper will retry a failed request before giving up. Default is 100.
