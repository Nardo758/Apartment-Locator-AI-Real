FAQ
How many fields does the property endpoint return? Over 350. That includes nested objects like address (8 fields), financials (7 fields), facts (10 fields), features (16 arrays), parking (5 fields), HOA (5 fields), rooms (array with dimensions), flags (14 booleans), and more. Plus optional sub-resources: photos, schools, similar properties, price/tax/Zestimate history, agent, and affordability.

What is a ZPID? Zillow Property ID. A unique number identifying each property on Zillow. You get ZPIDs from search results, and then use them to fetch full details. Example: 19977945.

Can I search for rentals? Yes. Set status=for_rent on any search endpoint. Works with all the same filters (price, beds, baths, etc.).

Can I search for recently sold properties? Yes. Set status=sold to get recently sold properties with sale prices.

What's the difference between /search and /search/coordinates? /search takes a location name ("Miami, FL") and resolves it automatically. /search/coordinates takes explicit map bounds (north/south/east/west lat/lng) for custom map-based interfaces.

How do I get photos? Add include=photos to any property or building request. Each photo comes with URLs in multiple resolutions — from thumbnails to full-size originals.

What are batch endpoints for? Instead of making 50 individual API calls, you send one batch request with up to 50 ZPIDs. Each item in the batch counts as one API call for billing, but you save on latency and connection overhead. Same for batch search: 10 different location searches in one request.

How do I paginate search results? Use page=1, page=2, etc. (up to page 1000). Or use cursor-based pagination with the next_cursor value returned in the response.

Is the data real-time? Data comes directly from Zillow. Search results are cached for 15 minutes, property details for 1 hour. Mortgage rates refresh every 5 minutes.

What US markets are covered? All of them. Every property, city, ZIP code, and neighborhood on Zillow is accessible through this API.
