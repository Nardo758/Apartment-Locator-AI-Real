I just pushed production-ready changes to my Apartment Locator AI platform on branch `claude/production-ready-prep-WJeo5`. I need you to pull the latest changes and verify everything integrates correctly. Here's what was changed:

## Round 1 - Production Hardening (commit d0bfd4f)

**server/index.ts** - Added CORS middleware with environment-aware origins, 3 rate limiters (auth: 20/15min, payments: 10/15min, API: 100/min), environment variable validation at startup, and configurable PORT via env.

**server/routes/payments.ts** - Replaced all hardcoded `http://localhost:5000` URLs with a `getFrontendUrl()` helper that reads FRONTEND_URL from env (throws in production if missing). Removed `details: error.message` from all 6 error responses to prevent info disclosure.

**server/routes/lease-verification.ts** - Added input validation for rent amounts (parseInt with 1-100000 range check). Implemented the Stripe refund that was a TODO stub - it now looks up `purchase.stripePaymentIntentId`, calls `stripe.refunds.create()` with amount in cents, and updates verification status to "refunded". Removed error details from all responses.

**src/lib/queryClient.ts** - Added JWT Bearer token injection into all API requests via `getHeaders()`. Added 401 detection that auto-redirects to /auth.

**src/App.tsx** - Converted 30+ page imports to React.lazy() with Suspense wrapper and PageLoader spinner. Only LandingSSRSafe, AuthModern, and NotFound are eagerly loaded.

**vite.config.ts** - Added manual chunks for vendor splitting: vendor-react, vendor-ui, vendor-charts, vendor-query. Reduced chunk warning limit to 500kB.

**src/contexts/OnboardingFlowContext.tsx** - Wrapped all JSON.parse/parseInt calls in try-catch blocks.

**Removed 20+ console.log statements** across: UnifiedAIContext.tsx, unified-rental-intelligence.ts, useUnifiedRentalIntelligence.ts, apartmentiq-ai.ts, LocationIntelligence.tsx, SmartMap.tsx, redfin-scraper.ts, usePaywall.ts.

**Added .env to .gitignore** and created .env.example template.

## Round 2 - Page Implementations (commit 0e495c4)

**src/pages/MarketIntel.tsx** - Built out all 3 tabs that were empty:
- Competitors tab: Regional rent comparison BarChart (Austin/Dallas/Houston by bedroom count), market position PieChart, competitor listings table with 5 properties showing rent, units, vacancy, DOM, concessions, trend arrows
- Analytics tab: 12-month rent trends AreaChart (min/median/avg/max lines), supply & demand BarChart, 5 key market stats with change badges, seasonal pricing guide with 4 seasons
- AI Insights tab: AI recommendation panel using intelligence data (leverage score, confidence, insights count), negotiation tips, market insights grid that renders intelligence.combinedInsights when available or falls back to static cards

**src/pages/SavedAndOffers.tsx** - Complete rewrite from mock data to real API integration:
- useQuery fetching from /api/saved-apartments/:userId
- Property details enrichment from /api/properties/:id for each saved apartment
- Delete mutation via apiRequest('DELETE') with query cache invalidation
- CSV export generating blob download
- Offers stored in localStorage with try-catch (no backend endpoint yet)
- Loading spinner, error state with retry, empty state with browse CTA
- Functional buttons: View Details navigates to /property/:id, Make Offer navigates to /generate-offer?propertyId=, Delete calls API mutation

## What I need you to do:

1. Pull the latest from branch `claude/production-ready-prep-WJeo5`
2. Run `PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=true npm install` (Puppeteer chromium download will fail in Replit)
3. Verify the build passes with `npx vite build`
4. Make sure `.env` has all required variables per `.env.example`
5. Start the dev server and verify:
   - CORS headers are present on API responses
   - Rate limiting is active (check X-RateLimit headers)
   - MarketIntel page renders all 3 tabs with charts and data
   - SavedAndOffers page loads, shows loading state, fetches from API
   - Lazy-loaded pages show the spinner before loading
   - No console.log spam in browser devtools
6. If any API endpoints are missing (like /api/saved-apartments/:userId or /api/properties/:id), create the necessary routes in the server to support the SavedAndOffers page
7. Report any TypeScript errors, runtime errors, or broken imports
